The resources that are used to create this are as follows:
* GLFW (Framework)
* ImGUI (Java Binding for C++ based ImGUI)
* [Learn OpenGL by Joey de Vries](https://learnopengl.com/ "Learn OpenGL")
* [3D Game Development w/ LWJGL 3](https://lwjglgamedev.gitbooks.io/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/content/ "3D Game Development w/ LWJGL 3")
* [Making a 2D Game w/ LWJGL3 and Java by Warmful Development](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILiqflMilIxta2xKk2EftiRHD4nQGW0u "Making a 2D Game w/ LWJGL3 and Java by Warmful Development")
